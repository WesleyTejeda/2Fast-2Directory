During his childhood, he befriend another Barstow local, Roman Pearce. The two often caused trouble together and played sports, such as football. As an adult, Brian joined the Los Angeles Police Department, which cost him his friendship with Roman, who did not trust the police. Two months into his earliest tenure on the force, Roman Pearce was arrested for housing stolen cars in a garage. While Brian was not involved in the Romanâ€™s arrest, Roman assumed he could have done something for him and later resented his childhood friend and his association with law enforcement.",

Roman and Brian grew up together, and often caused trouble together and played sports. Roman and Brian attended high school together, and often dated the same girls, Roman dating the girls Brian was no longer romantically involved with. When Roman and Brian attended prom, Roman presumably had sex with an undesirable girl nicknamed \"No Knees\" Denise. \nLike Brian, Roman turned to a life of crime and began stealing cars. When Brian joined the Los Angeles Police Department, Roman presumably distanced himself from Brian, considering him the \"enemy\". Two months into Brian's career as police officer, Rome was arrested for housing stolen cars in a garage. \nRoman believed that Brian, who was unaware of his arrest, could've done something to help him. While in prison, Roman later came to resent Brian. \nRoman spent three years in an upstate prison and was later released on house arrest. He was not allowed to move beyond a hundred yards from his home, a trailer home. He wore a monitor on his ankle leg that prohibited his movement. Roman was later employed as a driver for a Demolition Derby in Barstow",

For most of the race, Orange Julius is in third and is fighting over the spot with Suki, while Brian battles with Slap Jack for 1st place. She proceeds to ram his car and eventually gets past him. When they get to the bridge, Orange Julius freaks out and stops his car and decides not to continue on, while Suki successfully makes the bridge jump, finishing 2nd place. It is unknown whether or not he finished the race after the bridge went back to normal, as most of the street racers including Brian and Suki fled from the U.S Customs agents. Orange Julius appears again in the scramble scene when all the cars pour out and go in all different directions, helping Brian and Roman escape detection from the Miami Police and U.S. Customs. As most of the racers escape from the warehouse, he then states that the scramble is a \"big one\".",
